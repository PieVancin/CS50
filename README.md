# Using the Piano Keys
The piano consist of two octaves, 24 keys, being 14 white keys and 10 black keys. All of them can be played by simply clicking on them, or using the
following keys on the pc keyboard:
**z** to **m** for the white keys on the first octave, and **q** to **u** for the white keys on the second octave.
**s** to **j**, excluding **f**, for the black keys in the first octave, and **2** to **7**, excluding **4**, for the black keys of the second octave.

# Using the Metronome
There's a Metronome on the left corner of the screen. Initialy it's in the **OFF** state.
Press the **space bar** to activate the metronome, changing the state to **ON**
For the speed of the metronome, the **up key** of the keyboard can be used to increase it, and the **key down** to decrease it.
